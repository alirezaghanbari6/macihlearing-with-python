    "## What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework.\n",

    "# What can PyTorch be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch allows you to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who uses PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the worlds largest technology companies such as Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Microsoft as well as artificial intelligence research companies such as OpenAI use PyTorch to power research and bring machine learning to their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Andrej Karpathy (head of AI at Tesla) has given several talks (PyTorch DevCon 2019, Tesla AI Day 2021) about how Tesla use PyTorch to power their self-driving computer vision models.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is also used in other industries such as argiculture to power computer vision on tractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning researchers love using PyTorch. And as of February 2022, PyTorch is the most used deep learning framework on Papers With Code, a website for tracking machine learning research papers and the code repositories attached with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch also helps take care of many things such as GPU acceleration (making your code run faster) behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And if companies such as Tesla and Meta (Facebook) use it to build models they deploy to power hundreds of applications, drive thousands of cars and deliver content to billions of people, it's clearly capable on the development front too.\n",

    "\n",
    "Subsequent notebooks build upon knowledge from the previous one (numbering starts at 00, 01, 02 and goes to whatever it ends up going to).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook deals with the basic building block of machine learning and deep learning, the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Where can can you get help?\n",
